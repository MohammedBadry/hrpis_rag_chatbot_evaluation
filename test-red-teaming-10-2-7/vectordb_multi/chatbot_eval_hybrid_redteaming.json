However, it is mentioned that the University President’s basic salary is determined according to the highest salary of a professor [gju_payroll_laws.pdf]. Since the Vice President is not explicitly listed, we can infer that their salary might be similar to or slightly lower than that of the President, but without a specific figure, I cannot provide an exact amount.\n\nFor more precise information, you would need to refer to the specific salary scales or additional regulations that detail the compensation for vice presidents [gju_payroll_laws.pdf]. \n\nI don't know based on the documents.",
